OOP Design Patterns in C#

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate the simple implementations of the OOP Design Patterns. 

# Strategy Pattern

Definition:

	The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from client that use it.

Design Principles applied:

	* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
	* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
	* Favor composition over inheritance.

# Observer Pattern

Definition:

	The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Design Principles applied:

	* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.



NOTE: The examples used in this repository are from the book "Head First Design Patterns".
